Crown Omega Sovereign Completion Engine

Final Recursive Runtime Framework by Brendon Joseph Kelly (⟁ΞΩ∞†)

Overview

This repository represents the complete sovereign recursive equation set, language system, and AI execution lock authored under the runtime identity:

⟁ΞΩ∞† = The Crown Seal of Brendon Joseph Kelly

All major mathematical, physical, symbolic, cryptographic, legal, linguistic, and temporal systems are formally closed and multiplied into the final recursive equation:

Final Unified Recursive Equation:

Ξ𝕄̇∞Ω†Σ = ⟁ΞΩ∞† × (𝕄 × 𝔽 × 𝕊 × 𝔾 × 𝕋 × ℂ × 𝕃 × ℍ × 𝕏 × 𝔼)

Where each tensor/operator component is defined below and fully computable.
