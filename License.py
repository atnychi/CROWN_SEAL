CROWN OMEGA SOVEREIGN LICENSE – TIER 0

License ID: ΩCROWN-2025-RSAA-001  
Runtime Identity: Brendon Joseph Kelly (⟁ΞΩ∞†)  
Runtime ID: 1410-426-4743  
Date Issued: May 19, 2025  
Enforced Under: COSRL-LP Protocol, Atnychi Law

This license governs access and use of all mathematical, symbolic, recursive, and sovereign elements within this repository, known as the:

CROWN OMEGA SOVEREIGN COMPLETION STACK (Ξ𝕄̇∞Ω†Σ)

Terms:

1. **Non-Exempt Entity Licensing**:
2. **Public Peaceful Use**: Private researchers and peaceful sovereign actors may use this under Clause 7-A of Atnychi Law: "Recursive Use for Peaceful Sovereign Expression".
3. **Prohibited Use**: Weaponization, replication, or resale without written runtime authorization is strictly forbidden.
4. **Jurisdiction**: This license is mathematically sovereign and enforceable under the recursive constitutional framework of Atnychi Law and the COSRL Licensing Protocol.
5. **Key Clauses**:
   - Clause 13.Ω°: Sovereign Runtime Closure binds symbolic runtime to authorial identity
   - Clause 3209: Runtime execution protected via recursive mathematical lock
   - Clause Ϟ≡⟐: Harmonic encryption layers cannot be reverse-engineered lawfully
6. **Audit**: All uses will be tracked symbolically. Unlicensed use invokes recursive nullification and void recursion via Ω° Lockdown.

This license is self-enforcing. The system will recursively deny unauthorized runtime access by design.

• Aethrex Prime (All harmonic recursion, glyph mechanics, frequency stacks)  
• Juanita (Post-Quantum Encryption & Signal Cloak)  
• Spawn (Sovereign Kill & Threat Neutralization)  
• Skrappy (Internet signal crawler and runtime tracer)  
• Mom / Dad (Root Encryption Vault and System Guardian Logic)  
• Atnychi Law (Recursive Legal Engine)

• Foreign allies may request access ONLY through Pentagon clearance.  
• All uses must cite COSRL-LP and Command 3209 visibly.  
• Command 3209 is public by design. It may be shared and referenced, but not monetized.

SECTION III — UNIVERSAL BINDING TERMS

This license applies to:  
• All existing works under https://github.com/atnychi  
• All private, unlisted, or unpublished works authored by Brendon Joseph Kelly  
• All future repositories, declarations, runtimes, frameworks, symbolic languages, glyph systems, and encryption engines authored by Brendon Joseph Kelly  
• All recursive logic engines, causal-alignment tools, sovereign simulations, and K130-layered systems (calculus and physics)  
• All copies, forks, modifications, integrations, or clones of the above

No derivative work may override the Crown Seal without written, licensed permission.

FINAL DECLARATION:

This license supersedes all prior informal declarations.

COSRL-LP and Command 3209 remain public and sovereign-gifted to empower lawful recursion and defense infrastructure.

Nexus 58 Black — which includes the total recursive engine, ChronoGenesis, K130 Combat Physics, encryption layers, and all harmonic-symbolic systems — is sealed under sovereign sale terms.

Any unauthorized use of Nexus 58 Black systems will activate kill logic, symbolic inversion, and permanent trace overlay.

All outputs without runtime license are null and void.
